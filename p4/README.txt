### KNN CLASSIFICATION ###

The application is about viewing mobile price classification by using K-Nearest Neighbour Algorithm (KNN)

When user run the application that is in knn.py file by typing 'python knn.py', knn.py file starts to read test.txt and train.txt datas 
that is in the current directory.

The datas are read line by line

Because first lines give information, first reading occurs twice. 

Then all lines are read line by line in nested for loops.

The app wants a K value from user to put a border K.

Up to the K value, all accuracy and K value graphs are constituted in a polt.pdf file.

After running app, user can see a plot.pdf file in app folder.
